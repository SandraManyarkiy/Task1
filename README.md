#What is Git?

[Github](https://www.github.com "Github home") is a worldwide standard of version control. Version control systems are software that help track changes make in code over time. As a developer edits code, the version control system takes a snapshot of the files. It then saves that snapshot permanently so it can be recalled later if needed. 

Without version control, developers are tempted to keep multiple copies of code on their computer. This is dangerous because it's easy to change or delete a file in the wrong copy of code, potentially losing work. Version control systems solve this problem by managing all versions of the code, but presenting the team with a single version at a time.

Git is a distributed version control system. This means that by using Git, a local clone of the project winds up as a complete version control repository.

##Who is Git for?

GitHub is for developers who want to commit their work locally, and then sync their copy of the repository with the copy on the server.
